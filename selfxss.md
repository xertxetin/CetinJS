# Understanding Self-XSS Scams on CetinJS

**Self-XSS (Self-Cross-Site Scripting)** is a scam technique that tricks users into pasting malicious code into their browser's console. This type of scam falsely promises access to another account, rewards, or other benefits, while actually compromising your account.

## How Does Self-XSS Work?

Self-XSS scams are typically executed in the following ways:

1. **Deceptive Messages:** Scammers lure users with fake messages or webpages asking them to paste a code into the browser console.
2. **Account Takeover:** The pasted code steals session tokens or access credentials, granting the scammer control of the account.
3. **Rapid Spread:** Compromised accounts are used to send automated messages or posts targeting other users.

## Why Is It Dangerous?

- **Account Security Risk:** Pasting malicious code can give scammers full control over your account.
- **Malware Threats:** Self-XSS can be a gateway for downloading harmful software.
- **Threat to Your Friends:** A compromised account may be used to target your friends or contacts.
